Hello World!

The 'login.html' file in this folder incorporates use of a the Login API from google which uses Javasript.

Now, for this html file to work as intended and to make proper use of the API, it is necessary to host it. So, in order to host
this file on your localhost - which is added to the known client list on Google - you might want to use a server software
like XAMPP (https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

Cheers!
